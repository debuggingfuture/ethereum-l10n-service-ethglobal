00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
大家早上好。近況如何？我是Karthik，ETH Global的共同創辦人之一，我想正式歡迎大家來到Pragma。

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
這當然是世界上最大的活動之一。今天有來自39個不同國家的420多人參加Pragma。

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
我們的目標是涵蓋這個領域正在發生的一切，以及我們認為你們應該關心的事情。

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
丹佛市非常令人興奮，尤其是在Pragma，這裡總是有最高品質的創始人和建設者。

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
ETH Global的活動就像是學習如何在去中心化技術中建設的藍籌活動。

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Web3、以太坊生態系統，是學習、會見黑客以及迅速提速的最佳場所。

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
我們今天討論了從人工智能的哲學問題到機會集，我們談論了應用機會。

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
我認為這個空間的未來非常光明。一年前在加密AI領域從活動角度來看，什麼都沒有發生。

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
這是第一次，我認為是第一次主要會議真正突出這一領域。

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
感覺像是我們多年來所做的基礎設施投資正在得到回報。

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.000
我認為我們再也沒有藉口不去構建基本上能被主流用戶使用的應用程式，讓他們既能享受到鏈上系統的好處，

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
但即使他們對加密本身一無所知也能使用這些應用程式。

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
所以感覺現在是時候了，2024年感覺將會是非常激動人心的一年。

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:44.000
我們可以提高我們的抱負。我們可以夢想比加密生態系統今天的大夢想還要宏大，不僅限於今天正在運作的事物。

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
世界不止於金融。世界不止於金錢。

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
我認為只要以太坊是實驗和新型鏈上原語的家，那麼生態系統將是強大的，將會持續增長。

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
一如既往，我愛Pragma。

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:09.000
這是第一次，我們正在建立一個真正讓每個人都站在同一起跑線上的全球經濟，給他們參與的機會，提高他們的經濟自由

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
從而提高他們的生活質量，創建更好的企業，培育更幸福的家庭。

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.000
因此，那條信息和那個願景就是來與我們一起建立這個鏈上全球經濟，這就是一切的意義所在。這就是我們為何在此。

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.000
我們得到了許多不可思議的創始人直接分享他們對產品未來、他們的協議未來以及這個生態系統其餘部分的想法。

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:44.000
最棒的部分是他們之後都留下來，與大家在外面交談並回答所有的問題。在別的地方你根本無法獲得這樣的經歷。

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
我給建設者的建議是不要害羞。像這樣的活動非常容易接觸。

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000
你會見到來自這個空間各種不同背景的人。他們想與你交談。他們想讓你參與進來。這是一個非常歡迎的生態系統，但你可能需要主動邁出第一步。

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
你會看到，我認為你將永遠不想回頭。

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
你可以和你可能在互聯網上欽佩的協議建設者擦肩而過，他們就在那裡，你可以問他們問題，他們非常容易接觸。

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
所以，是的，去參加這樣的活動，不要害怕提問。

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:22.000
哦，我的天，這太棒了。很多真正強大的開發者來到這裡。很多非常好的互動。你知道，人們試圖圍繞以太坊的核心價值觀建立社區。

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:33.000
對我來說，Pragma與其他一切的不同之處在於，重點非常在於人們分享觀點，而不是在新聞中談論他們想要討論的營銷內容。

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
我們的目標是想推動整個空間的進步，而不僅僅是談論我們認

為對我們公司的舊目標有益的事情。

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:53.000
來這裡的演講者可以這樣做。他們進行健康的討論，有時候與彼此進行友好的爭吵，他們真正觸及到我們所有人共同試圖解決的問題的核心，以便我們能夠使整個生態系統變得更好。

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
我們每次都能親眼見到，我們迫不及待地想在今年再做五次。

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
謝謝。

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Good morning everybody. How's it going? I'm Karthik, one of the co-founders of ETH Global and I want to officially welcome all of you to Pragma.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This, of course, is one of the biggest events in the world. We have over 420 people from 39 different countries attending Pragma today.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The goal here is to cover everything happening in this space and the things that we think you should care about.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Denver is super exciting, especially at Pragma where there's always the most high quality founders and builders in the space.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
ETH Global events are like the blue chip event for learning how to build in decentralized technology.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Web3, the Ethereum ecosystem, it's the best place to learn, to meet hackers, and to come up to speed really quickly.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We talked about everything from philosophical problems with AI today, the opportunity set. We talked about application opportunities.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And I think the takeaway is the future of this space is super bright. There was nothing happening in crypto AI from an event standpoint a year ago.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This is the first, I think, one of the first major conferences to really highlight this area.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It feels like a lot of the infrastructure investments we've been making for years are paying off.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And I don't think we have excuses anymore not to build basically apps that can be used by mainstream users that give them both the benefit of on-chain systems,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
but allow them to use them even if they don't know anything about crypto itself.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So it feels like the time is now and 2024 feels like it's going to be a very exciting year.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We can raise our ambitions. We can dream bigger than even the big dreams that the crypto ecosystem has today and not limit ourselves to only the things that are working today.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The world is bigger than finance. The world is bigger than money.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I think as long as Ethereum is the home of experimentation and new kinds of on-chain primitives, then the ecosystem will be strong and will be growing.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
As always, I love Pragma.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:09.000
For the first time, we're building a global economy that actually puts everyone on a level playing field and gives them the opportunity to participate and to increase their economic freedom

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and thereby increase their quality of life, build better businesses, raise happier families.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And so that message and that vision of come build with us and build this on-chain global economy, that's what it's all about. And that's why we're here.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We got so many incredible founders to share directly what they were thinking about for the future of their product, the future of their protocols, and the rest of this ecosystem.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And the best part of it is that they all then stayed around and talked to everybody outside and answered all their questions. And you just can't get that experience anywhere else.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The advice that I would give to builders is don't be shy. Events like this, they're super accessible.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You have people from all different walks of the space accessible. They want to talk to you. They want to get you involved. It's a super welcoming ecosystem, but you have to sort of maybe take that first step.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And you'll see, and I think you'll never want to go back.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
You can kind of rub shoulders with protocol builders that you might admire on the internet, and they're just like right there, and you can ask them questions, and they're super accessible.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So just, yeah, go to events like this and not be afraid to ask questions.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Oh my god, this has been so awesome. Lots of really strong developers showing up here. Lots of really good interactions. You know, people trying to build community around the core values of Ethereum.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:33.000
To me, the thing that differentiates Pragma from everything else is that the focus is very much on people sharing ideas and not about marketing what they want to talk about in the news.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The goal here is that we want to move the rest of the space forward and not just talk about what we think is good for our company's old goals.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And the speakers who come here get to do that. They have healthy discussions, sometimes nicer fights with each other, and they really get to the crux of what is the problem that we're all collectively trying to solve so we can make this entire ecosystem better.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And we get to see that every time in person, and we can't wait to do that five more times this year.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Thank you.
